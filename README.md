# Easybank Landing

## Description
A landing page for a mock banking company. Created for a [frontendmentor.io](frontendmentor.io) challenge where the assets and style guides are provided but you are allowed to implement the design in any way you wish. For this challenge I chose the technologies listed below. The file structure is inspired by [Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) but it does not implement every possible level due to project size.

## Technologies 
- Next.js
- React
- Styled Components
- HTML
